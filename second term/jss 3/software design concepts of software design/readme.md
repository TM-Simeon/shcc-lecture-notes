software design is simple calculator program in C that demonstrates various software design concepts, including modularity, encapsulation, user interaction, and error handling. This program supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Key Software Design Concepts Demonstrated:

Modularity:
Functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, and performOperation) are used to encapsulate specific tasks, promoting modularity.

Encapsulation:
Functions encapsulate related operations, and the performOperation function encapsulates the logic for handling different operators.

User Interaction:
The program interacts with the user to input numbers and an operator using printf and scanf for console-based interaction.

Error Handling:
The program includes basic error handling, such as checking for division by zero or an invalid operator. Error messages are displayed to inform the user.
