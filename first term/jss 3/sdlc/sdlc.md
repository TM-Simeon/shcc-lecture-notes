Requirements Gathering:

Define the problem: Create a list of equations that your program should be able to solve (quadratic, simultaneous, polynomial).
Identify user expectations and any additional features you want to include.
Planning:

Define the scope: Clearly outline what the program will and will not do.
Break down the project into smaller tasks.
Create a timeline for completing each task.
Design:

Define the data structures: Determine how you'll represent equations and their solutions in your program.
Plan the algorithm: Decide on the approach for solving each type of equation.
Create a flowchart or pseudocode to illustrate the program's logic.
Implementation (Coding):

Write the C code based on the design.
Start with a simple function for solving quadratic equations.
Expand to handle simultaneous equations.
Implement a function for polynomial equations.
Testing:

Test your program with various inputs to ensure it produces correct results.
Consider edge cases and invalid inputs.
Debug and fix any issues that arise.
Deployment:

Package your program for distribution.
Create documentation for users.
Maintenance:

Address any bugs or issues reported by users.
Consider adding new features or improvements.
